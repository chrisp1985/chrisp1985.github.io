            <h2>This WebSite</h2>
            <p>My intention in creating this site was to a) show the coding I've done so far and b) have a play around with the bits I've been learning about outside of work. </p>

            <h2>What's in it?</h2>
            <p>The main tab control in the Tools section, for instance, uses an angular controller to set the active tab. The accordion element that houses the code is jquery.</p>
            <p>There's a bit of CSS dotted about, but mainly I'm just using what boostrap gives you with a few additional bits. The CSS for the code block was from prism (see the source).</p>

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>The reason I've put this together is basically to learn more background info on the web apps I test, and to understand what I should or shouldn't be hooking into. For instance, I know that an ng-init has its uses in early designs, but really any initialisation code should be going into a controller. The less logic in HTML the better.</p>
            <p>This isn't a comprehensive website by any means but hopefully demonstrates a bit of understanding about what I'm testing.</p>

            <h2>How is it hosted?</h2>
            <p>The website at http://chrisp1985.github.io is obviously hosted on GitHub. Storing data on Github allows automatic hosting of websites, as long as you've got an index.html available.
            <p>If you're viewing this website at http://chrisp1985.ddns.net:8082/index.html , you're viewing the data as hosted on a Raspberry Pi Zero! The Pi is using the Forever npm module to run a NodeJS Server, which is executing a server javascript file. The site occasionally goes down, because the Pi Zero is using iffy Wifi on a dongle in our bedroom upstairs, and the router supplied by our ISP isn't great (hello TalkTalk!).</p>
